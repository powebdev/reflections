When Git init was first called, it seems that only a place 
holder repository was created. I need to tell Git which 
files to track for the repository and when the commit 
message should be each time I want to commit the files.

It serves as an intermediate step before making a final 
commit on the files. I think it helps to organize the 
committing steps better.

By putting only the files in the same group if they make 
sense, and do the commit in batches so each commit makes 
logical sense.

Branches are useful when you want to experiment or test 
new features on your program and doesn't want the working 
version of the program to be affected. By creating branches 
any changes made too the code will not alter the original 
version of the code.

It shows the branches in a more physically relate-able way.

By merging two branches together, the two diverging group of 
commits are joined together in one single commit.

Automatic merging can make the job of merging two commits 
a lot easier and faster. But it can not resolve conflicts 
automatically. Manually merging requires more time, but 
with human intervention we can do our best to make sure 
merge go as intended.
