When Git init was first called, it seems that only a place 
holder repository was created. I need to tell Git which 
files to track for the repository and when the commit 
message should be each time I want to commit the files.

It serves as an intermediate step before making a final 
commit on the files. I think it helps to organize the 
committing steps better.
